Turing School of Software &amp; Design's Mod 2 Static Comp Solo Project

## Choose That Player Character!

*Choose That Player Character* is my rendition of Turing's Static Comp project for Mod 2. Specs [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html) for the project.

The goal was to recreate the layout of the option of our choice, and we had creative integrity over almost everything else with a few guidelines and helpful links to resources. I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the card images and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) for the icons.

This was a fun, ungraded project that helped rehearse HTML and CSS skills.
