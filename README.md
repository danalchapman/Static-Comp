# Static-Comp

Turing School of Software &amp; Design's Mod 2 Static Comp Solo Project

## Choose That Player Character!

*Choose That Player Character* is my rendition of Turing's Static Comp project for Mod 2. Specs [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html) for the project.

The goal was to recreate the layout of the option of our choice, and we had creative integrity over almost everything else with a few guidelines and helpful links to resources. I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the card images and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) for the icons.

This was a fun, ungraded project that helped rehearse HTML and CSS skills.

## Set Up 

1. Clone down to your local machine
2. `cd` into the local directory
3. Run `open index.html` to view the page

## Skills Practiced

1. HTML
2. CSS

## Celebrations & Challenges

#### Celebrations

This was a fun project overall, just getting to flex and grow the HTML and CSS skills in our nine weeks at Turing. Getting creative freedom for the content of the page was fun, and figuring out how to create the layout (and to make it dynamic) was a fun aspect.

#### Challenges

I could not quite figure out how to impose text over the images in the cards -- ie. Views and the Icon that are in the specs for Option 1. That's something that I want to work on going forward, if I have time to revisit this comp. I also struggled with aligning the image flush against the card box, and is something else I'd like to work on.
